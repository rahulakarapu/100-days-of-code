# 100-days-of-code
My attempt at the challenge to code for 100 consecutive days. I plan to primarily solve one problem everyday from Leetcode or Hackerrank and post my solution and an explanation in this repo.

My language of choice to solve the problems will be JavaScript.

## Logs

My daily progress is available in the [log file](LOG.md).
