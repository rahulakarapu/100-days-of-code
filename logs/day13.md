**Difficulty**: Medium

---

**Solution**: [JavaScript](../solutions/swapping-nodes-linked-list.js)

**Time complexity**: O(N) since we iterate over the entire linked list to convert it to an array, and then over the entire array to rebuild the new linked list.

**Space complexity**: O(N) since we store all elements of the linked list in an array.
