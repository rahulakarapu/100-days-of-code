**Problem**: [(LeetCode) 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)  
**Difficulty**: Easy

---

**Solution**: [JavaScript](../solutions/merge-two-sorted-lists.js)

**Time complexity**: O(m + n) where m and n are the lengths of the two lists, since we traverse the two lists just once while merging.

**Space complexity**: O(1) since constant space is used for temporary variables.
