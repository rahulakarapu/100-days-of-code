**Problem**: [(LeetCode) 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)  
**Difficulty**: Medium

---

**Solution**: [JavaScript](../solutions/lowest-common-ancestor-binary-tree.js)

**Time complexity**: O(N) since perform a depth-first traversal of the tree.

**Space complexity**: O(N) since in the worst case (skewed tree) we have to push every node onto the stack while performing depth-first traversal.
